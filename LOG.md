- Integrating SerpAPI to collect AI overview responses

## Fri, 13 June

- Reading SerpAPI docs, testing

## Thu, 12 June

- Designed a simple reproducible pipeline
- 9M+ queries -> AI overview trigger filtering -> random sampling -> Google AI Overview response (SerpAPI)
- Manually checked v1 filter (~62% out of 50 samples trigger Google AI overview)

## Wed, 11 June

- Identified and compared query datasets, selected MS MARCO (2024, 9M+ real Bing queries)
- Drafted a data collection pipeline
- (!) Not all queries trigger AI overviews
- Tested some simple filters that predict if a query is likely to trigger AI overview (open ended questions, keyword matching)

## Tue, 10 June

- Tracked data sources of shared studies
- Investigated AI Overview results APIs/scraping feasibility and practicality
- Selected SerpAPI as the cost effective, quick to setup, reliable approach

## Mon, 9 June
