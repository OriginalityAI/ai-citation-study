        "Puberty and Growth Plates: Growth in height is largely determined by the growth plates in long bones. These plates typically close by the end of puberty, which usually occurs between 16 and 18 for boys.  ",
        "Individual Variation: Puberty timing varies, and some boys experience a later onset, meaning their growth plates might close later, potentially allowing for growth into their early twenties.  ",
        "Beyond Height: Even after height stops increasing, men continue to develop in other ways, such as muscle mass and bone density, well into their twenties.  ",
        "Rare Cases: While rare, some individuals might experience a small amount of height growth even after their early twenties, but significant height increases after 21 are uncommon.  "
