      "question": "Why a coin at the bottom of the water tank appears to be raised?",
      "answer": "A coin at the bottom of a water tank appears to be raised due to the phenomenon of refraction. Refraction occurs when light travels from one medium to another, such as from water to air, causing it to change speed and direction. Here’s how it works: 1. Light Transmission: When light rays from the coin travel upward through the water and into the air, they change speed because water is denser than air. 2. Bending of Light: As the light exits the water, it bends away from the normal line (an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface). This bending makes the coin appear at a different position than where it actually is. 3. Visual Perception: Our brain interprets the light as coming in a straight line. Since the light has been bent, the coin appears to be at a higher position than its actual location at the bottom of the tank. This effect can be observed in various situations, such as looking at objects underwater or even seeing a straw appear bent when placed in a glass of water.",

      "question": "A coin placed at the bottom of a tank appears to be raised when water is poured into it. Explain.",
      "answer": "This occurs due to the, phenomenon of refraction of light. Here, the ray of light from the coin travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium. In this process it bends away from the normal. The point from which the refracted rays appear to come gives the apparent position of the coin. As the rays appear to come from a point above the coin, so, the coin seems to be raised.",

      "question": "Why does a coin kept in water appear to be raised",
      "answer": "Concepts: Refraction, Optics, Light behavior Explanation: When light travels from one medium to another, its speed changes, which causes it to bend. This bending of light is known as refraction. When you look at a coin submerged in water, the light rays coming from the coin travel from water (a denser medium) to air (a less dense medium). As the light exits the water, it bends away from the normal line, making the coin appear to be at a higher position than it actually is. Step by Step Solution: Step 1 Understand that light travels at different speeds in different mediums. Step 2 Recognize that when light moves from water to air, it bends due to refraction. Step 3 Realize that this bending causes the coin to appear raised when viewed from above the water. Final Answer: A coin in water appears raised due to the refraction of light as it moves from water to air, causing the light rays to bend and make the coin seem higher than its actual position.",

      "question": "Explain the following: A coin placed at the bottom of a vessel appears to be raised when water is poured in the vessel.",
      "answer": "The below ray diagram shows why a coin appears raised when placed in a vessel filled with water: When water is poured in the vessel, the ray of light from point A of the coin, travelling in a straight line changes its direction (i.e. it bends) at the surface of water and reaches the eye. The ray now appears to come from point B instead of point A to our eye. So, the coin appears to be raised from position A to position B.",
