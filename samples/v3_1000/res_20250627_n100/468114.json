        "Connecting Lineages: By marrying Keturah, Abraham's lineage is connected to these tribes, which is significant in understanding the relationships between different groups in the region.  ",
        "Alternative Perspective: Some interpretations, particularly within Jewish tradition, identify Keturah with Hagar, Abraham's former concubine. This perspective suggests that Hagar returned to Abraham after Sarah's death, and they had more children.  ",
        "Symbolic Significance: Some scholars interpret Keturah's name, which is linked to incense, as symbolic of the aromatic spices traded by the tribes descended from her.  ",
        "Contrast with Sarah: The inclusion of Keturah and her children also highlights the special status of Sarah and Isaac, as they are the ones through whom the covenant with God is continued.  ",
        "End of an Era: Abraham's marriage to Keturah is often seen as the final chapter in his life, following the death of Sarah and the marriage of Isaac.  "
