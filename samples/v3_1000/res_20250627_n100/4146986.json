      "snippet": "Top comment · My wife and I don't have a fancy deep fryer, so we use a regular pot. There are often little bits left over that even after straining can remain and burn. I'd say we use the oil a maximum of five times before changing it on average, but we mix fish, chicken, and vegetables wildly (maybe a bit barbaric, but oh well). We're not experts, just happy amateurs, so take it for what it is. One last comment. You probably already know this, but don't pour the oil down the sink when you dispose of it, as it clogs pipes.",
