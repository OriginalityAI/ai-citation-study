        "Benefits: Includes all Gold Star benefits, plus an annual 2% reward on qualified Costco purchases (up to a maximum of $1,000) and additional discounts on select services like Costco Travel.  ",
        "Best for: Shoppers who spend $3,250 or more annually at Costco, as the 2% reward can offset the higher membership fee.  ",
        "1.  Calculate your annual Costco spending: If you spend less than $3,250 annually, the Gold Star membership is likely sufficient.  ",
        "2.  Consider other Executive benefits: If you frequently use Costco Travel, insurance services, or other discounted services, the Executive membership might be worth it, even if your spending is slightly below the $3,250 threshold.  ",
        "3.  Factor in potential savings: If you're on the fence, calculate the potential savings from the 2% reward based on your estimated spending. If the potential reward exceeds the $65 difference between the two memberships, the Executive membership is likely the better choice, according to Quora.  "
