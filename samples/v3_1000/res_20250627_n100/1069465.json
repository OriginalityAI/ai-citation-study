      "question": "In what ways can citizen participation contribute to good governance?",
      "answer": "As someone working on deliberative democracy and its practices, I think we should not exaggerate electoral accountability. Of course it is better than nothing however it is not an effective way of ensuring a democratic system. At the end of the day, we are talking about a power that can be used every 4 or 5 years. Such power is simply not powerful. The lack of citizen power in politics is a systemic issue. Unless the ideas and perspectives of citizens are transmitted to the political arena, we cannot talk about the power of people. Education is crucially important. With better education people's voting preferences might have better bases. However, this does not make the system any more democratic than it is now unless people have more chances of effecting the policy making. This needs a better systemic environment than electoral politics. Here, I think deliberative and participatory models offer great ways of political decision-making.",

      "answer": "vote join a political party help with a campaign join a civic group join a community group give an elected official your opinion on an issue call Senators and Representatives publicly support or oppose an issue or policy run for office write to a newspaper Citizens play an active part in their communities. When Americans engage in the political process, democracy stays alive and strong. There are many ways for people to be involved. They can volunteer to help new immigrants learn English and civics, join the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) of their child's school, run for a position on the local school board, or volunteer to help at a polling station. People can also vote, help with a political campaign, join a civic or community organization, or call their senator or representative about an issue that is important to them",

      "answer": "Ways Citizens Can Participate Responsibly in a Democratic State Voting: Citizens can participate responsibly in a democratic state by exercising their right to vote in elections. This allows them to have a say in the selection of their representatives and the direction of their country. Engagement in Civil Discourse: Engaging in civil discourse involves respectfully discussing and debating political issues with others. This can be done through community meetings, social media, or other platforms, allowing citizens to contribute to the exchange of ideas and the formation of public opinion. Community Involvement: Citizens can participate responsibly by getting involved in their communities through volunteering, joining local organizations, or attending town hall meetings. This allows them to contribute to the betterment of their local area and stay informed about local issues.",

      "question": "So I'm a huge advocate of something known as sortition , where people are randomly selected to serve in a legislature. Unfortunately the typical gut reaction against sortition is bewilderment and skepticism. How could we possibly trust ignorant, stupid, normal people to become our leaders? Democracy by Lottery Imagine a Congress that actually looks like America. It's filled with nurses, farmers, engineers, waitresses, teachers, accountants, pastors, soldiers, stay-at-home-parents, and retirees. They are conservatives, liberals, and moderates from all parts of the country and all walks of life. For a contemporary implementation, a lottery is used to draw around 100 to 1000 people to form one house of a Congress. Service is voluntary and for a fixed term. To alleviate the problem of rational ignorance , chosen members could be trained by experts or even given an entire elite university education before service. Because of random sampling , a sortition Citizens' Assembly would have superior diversity in every conceivable dimension compared to any elected system. Sortition is also the ultimate method of creating a proportionally representative Congress. The History of Sortition Democratic lotteries are an ancient idea whose usage is first recorded in ancient Athens in 6th century BC. Athens was most famous for its People's Assembly, in which any citizen could participate (and was paid to participate) in direct democracy. However, the Athenians also invented several additional institutions as checks and balances on the passions of the People's Assembly. First, the Council of 500, or the Boule, were 500 citizens chosen by lottery. This group developed legislative proposals and organized the People’s Assemblies. In addition, lottery was used to choose the composition of the People’s Court, which would check the legality of decisions made by the People’s Assembly. Most government officials were chosen by lottery from a preselected group to make up the Magistracies of Athens. Athens used a mixture of both election and lottery to compose their government. Positions of strategic importance, such as Generals, were elected. The Character of Democracy Athenian democracy was regarded by Aristotle as a “radical democracy”, a state which practiced the maxim “To be ruled and rule by turns” [2 pp. 71]. For Aristotle, “It is accepted as democratic when public offices are allocated by lot; and as oligarchic when they are filled by election.” Renaissance writers thought so too. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu states, “Voting by lot is the nature of democracy; voting by choice is in the nature of aristocracy.” How is it that ancient and Renaissance philosophers understood democracy to be selection by lottery, while modern people understand democracy to be a system of elections? Democracy was redefined by Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville while he travelled through the United States in the early 1800’s. Tocqueville was impressed by the equality of the social and economic conditions of Americans in the early years of the republic. Importantly, Tocqueville believed that the institutions of American “township democracy”, law, and the practice of the tyranny of the majority made America a land of democracy. Therefore he wrote and titled a book, Democracy in America, that redefined America as a democracy rather than the aristocratic republic which its founding fathers had desired. Tocqueville’s book would become a best-seller around the world. With Tocqueville’s redefinition of democracy that excluded the practice of lot, the traditions of democracy were forgotten and replaced with the electoral fundamentalism of today. From historican & advocate David Reybrouck, “Electoral fundamentalism is an unshakeable belief in the idea that democracy is inconceivable without elections and elections are a necessary and fundamental precondition when speaking of democracy. Electoral fundamentalists refuse to regard elections as a means of taking part in democracy, seeing them instead as an end in themselves, as a holy doctrine with an intrinsic, inalienable value.” [1 pp 39]. Late political scientist Robert Dahl suggested that the ideal of democracy is the “logic of equality” [3]. Three techniques of democracy were developed in ancient times to move towards political equality: direct participation, the lottery, and the election. Today, with public distrust of democratic government at all-time highs throughout the entire world, perhaps it’s time we democratise our democracies. Perhaps it’s time to bring back the technique of democracy by lottery. Real World Evidence It would be absurd to try out a crazy new system without testing it. Fortunately, sortition activists have been experimenting with hundreds of sortition-based Citizens' Assemblies across the world. The decisions they have come to have been of high quality in my opinion. For example: The BC Columbia Citizens Assembly was tasked with designing a new electoral system to replace the old first-past-the-post (FPTP) system. The organizers brought in university experts. The organizers also allowed citizens, lobbyists, and interest groups to speak and lobby. Assembly members listened to all the sides, and they decided that the lobbyists were mostly bullshit, and they decided that even though the university experts had biases, they were more trustworthy. This assembly ultimately, nearly unanimously decided that Canada ought to switch to a Single-Transferable-Vote style election system. They were also nearly unanimous in that they believed FPTP voting needed to be changed. This assembly demonstrates the ability of normal people to learn and make decisions on complex topics. In Ireland , Citizen Assemblies were instrumental in the legalization of both gay marriage and abortion in a traditionally Catholic country. Ignorant politicians thought the People wouldn't be able to compromise on these moral issues, yet they certainly were, when you finally bothered to get them into a room together. Recent 2019-2020 Citizen Assemblies in Ireland and France reached consensus on sweeping, broad reforms to fight climate change. In Ireland taxes on carbon and meat were broadly approved. In France the People decided to criminalize \"ecocide\", raise carbon taxes, and introduce regulations in transportation and agriculture. Liberal or conservative, left or right, near unanimous decisions were made on many of these proposals. Unlike the much criticized People's Assemblies of Ancient Athens, modern Citizens' Assemblies operate on time scales greater than a single day or two of decision making, and use modern deliberative and legislative procedures. Comparing to Elections Sortition stands in stark contrast with what all elections offer. All electoral methods are a system of choosing a \"natural aristocracy\" of societal elites. This has been observed by philosophers such as Aristotle since ancient Greek elections 2400 years ago. In other words, all elections are biased in favor of those with wealth, affluence, and power. Moreover, all voters, including you and me, are rationally ignorant. Almost none of us have the time nor resources to adequately monitor and manage our legislators. In the aggregate as voters, we vote ignorantly, oftentimes solely due to party affiliation or the name or gender of the candidate. We assume somebody else is doing the monitoring, and hopefully we'd read about it in the news. And indeed it is somebody else - marketers, advertisers, lobbyists, and special interests - who are paying huge sums of money to influence your opinion. Every election is a hope that we can refine this ignorance into competence. IN CONTRAST, in Citizens' Assemblies, normal citizens are given the time, resources, and education to become informed. Normal citizens are also given the opportunity to deliberate with one another to come to compromise. IN CONTRAST, politicians constantly refuse to compromise for fear of upsetting ignorant voters - voters who did not have the time nor opportunity to research the issues in depth. Our modern, shallow, ignorant management of politicians has led to an era of unprecedented polarization, deadlock, and government ineptitude. Addressing Common Concerns Stupidity The typical rebuttal towards sortition is that people are stupid, unqualified, and cannot be trusted with power. Or, people are \"sheep\" who would be misled by the experts. Unfortunately such opinions are formed without evidence and based on anecdotal \"common sense\". And it is surely true that ignorant people exist, who as individuals make foolish decisions. Yet the vast majority of Americans have no real experience with actual Citizens' Assemblies constructed by lottery. The notion of group stupidity is an empirical claim. In contrast, the hundreds of actual Citizen Assembly experiments in my opinion demonstrate that average people are more capable of governance than common sense would believe. The political, academic, and philosophical opposition does not yet take sortition seriously enough to offer any counter-evidence of substance. Even in Jason Brennan's recent book \"Against Democracy\" , Brennan decides not to attack the latest developments in sortition, (though he does attempt to attack the practice of deliberative democracy on empirical grounds, but I think he cherry-picks too much) and even suggests using sortition as a way to construct his epistocratic tests. Unfortunately until sortition is given real power, we cannot know with certainty how well they would perform. Expertise The second concern is that normal citizens are not experts whereas elected politicians allegedly are experts. Yet in modern legislatures, no, politicians are not policy experts either. The sole expertise politicians qualify for is fundraising and giving speeches. Actual creation of law is typically handled by staff or outsourced to lobbyists. Random people actually have an advantage against elected politicians in that they don't need to waste time campaigning, and lottery would not select for power-seeking personalities. Corruption The third concern is with corruption. Yet sortition has a powerful advantage here as well. Corruption is already legalized in the form of campaign donations in exchange for friendly regulation or legislation. Local politicians also oftentimes shake down small businesses, demanding campaign donations or else be over-regulated. Sortition fully eliminates these legal forms of corruption. Finally sortition legislatures would be more likely to pass anti-corruption legislation, because they are not directly affected by it. Elected Congress is loath to regulate itself - who wants to screw themselves over? In contrast, because sortition assemblies serve finite terms, they can more easily pass legislation that affects the next assembly, not themselves. Opposition to Democracy The final rebuttal is the direct attack against democracy itself, waged for millennia by several philosophers including Plato. With thousands of years of debate on hand, I am not going to go further into that fight. I am interested in advocating for sortition over elections. Implementations As far as the ultimate form sortition would take, I will list options from least to most extreme: The least extreme is the use of Citizen Assemblies in an advisory capacity for legislatures or referendums, in a process called \"Citizens Initiative Review\" (CIR). These CIR's are already implemented for example in Oregon. Here, citizens are drafted by lot to review ballot propositions and list pro's and con's of the proposals. Many advocate for a two-house Congress, one elected and one randomly selected. This system attempts to balance the pro's and cons of both sortition and election. Rather than have citizens directly govern, random citizens can be used exclusively as intermediaries to elect and fire politicians as a sort of functional electoral college. The benefit here is that citizens have the time and resources to deploy a traditional hiring & managing procedure, rather than a marketing and campaigning procedure, to choose nominees. This also removes the typical criticism that you can't trust normal people to govern and write laws. Most radically, multi-body sortition constructs checks and balances by creating several sortition bodies - one decides on what issues to tackle, one makes proposals, one decides on proposals, one selects the bureaucracy, etc, and completely eliminates elected office. TLDR: Selecting random people to become legislators might seem crazy to some people, but I think it's the best possible system of representation and democracy we can imagine. There's substantial empirical evidence to suggest that lottery-based legislatures are quite good at resolving politically polarized topics. References Reybrouck, David Van. Against Elections.

      "answer": "In Athens sortation was deliberate to keep (basically what Americans would call the house of representatives) mediocre thus giving the Senate more power. Source: I took a very long Greek history course at university which was taught by an archeologist that had been on actual digs and understood the culture, politics, and history of ancient Greece. He argued that the sortation system is actually better than what we have in the US: \"It's not so much that power corrupts, but that power attracts the corruptible. Sortation neuters political ambition and dissolves the corruption that comes with it.\"",
