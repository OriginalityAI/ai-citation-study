Often, we might find ourselves praying amiss, asking God for things that serve our own desires rather than seeking His divine purpose. James 4:3 highlights that unanswered prayers can stem from selfish motives. As believers, it is crucial to examine the intentions behind our prayers. Are we seeking God's kingdom and righteousness, or are we primarily focused on our own pleasures and ambitions? To avoid praying amiss, we must cultivate a heart that desires God's will above our own. By doing so, we align ourselves with His perfect plan, ensuring that our prayers are in harmony with His purposes. Let us strive to pray with pure hearts, seeking not just our own gain, but the advancement of God's kingdom and the fulfillment of His will on earth.",
