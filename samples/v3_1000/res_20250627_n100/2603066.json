Then connect it to a working screen battery and buttons and aux boards, whatever the board minimally needs, and check. This will obviously do nothing to fix the device, except it will clear your conscience, you have done something and it was completely harmless, and you will have removed residual moisture and some contamination, stop future corrosion. EXCEPT I LIED, I HAD ONE \"DEAD\" PHONE BOARD MAGICALLY COME TO LIFE THIS WAY! Gotta take little victories wherever we can right? Yeah local repair stores usually offer \"professional cleaning\" for a waterlogged phone.",
