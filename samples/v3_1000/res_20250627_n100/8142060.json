      "snippet": "Top comment · I’m guessing you aren’t employed and if not that’s definitely a factor but the primary factor is going to be your previous financial problems and the only cure is time I’m afraid. Have a look at your credit report and see how many (if any) defaults and missed payments you have. They usually mean a lot less after 4 years. There are lenders out there for bad credit, and low income/benefits but if you can’t find anything that’s because it’s probably too soon after your previous issues - either that or your total income is just way to low to lend too.",
