        "Early Innovations: While the mechanical clock wasn't invented in a single moment, the earliest mechanical clocks emerged in Europe around the 11th century.  ",
        "Gerbert of Aurillac (Pope Sylvester II): He is credited with creating a device that tracked stellar motions, and is often cited as the inventor of the first mechanical clock.  ",
        "Su Song and Chang Ssu-Hsun: In China, Su Song created a water-powered astronomical clock tower in 1088, which featured the first known endless power-transmitting chain drive. Chang Ssu-Hsun also built a mechanical-water clock, though it didn't work perfectly.  ",
        "Peter Henlein: In the 16th century, the German locksmith Peter Henlein created the first portable spring-driven clocks, often called \"Nuremberg Eggs\". These were smaller and more portable than previous clocks but still lacked minute hands and had limited precision.  ",
        "Christiaan Huygens: In 1656, Christiaan Huygens invented the first pendulum clock, which significantly improved accuracy.  ",
        "Gradual Refinement: From the 17th century onwards, clockmakers continued to refine the design of mechanical clocks, leading to greater precision and more elaborate displays.  "
