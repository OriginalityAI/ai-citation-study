        "Dominion Mandate: Kingdom Now adherents believe that God has given humanity dominion over the Earth, and that Christians, through spiritual authority and influence, are tasked with reclaiming this dominion that was supposedly lost through Adam's sin.  ",

        "Seven Mountains: Some proponents focus on influencing specific \"mountains\" or sectors of society, including education, religion, family, business, government/military, arts/entertainment, and media, with the goal of transforming them from within according to Zana Magazine.  ",
        "Overcomers: They believe that a select group of Christians, often identified as \"overcomers,\" will play a key role in this process, sometimes even being seen as possessing divine qualities or being \"Manifest Sons of God\".  ",
        "Delayed Return of Christ: Some versions of Kingdom Now theology suggest that Christ's return is dependent on the Church's success in establishing God's Kingdom on Earth.  ",
        "Biblical Interpretation: Critics argue that Kingdom Now theology misinterprets certain scriptures and overemphasizes the Church's role in ushering in God's Kingdom, potentially neglecting the importance of individual transformation and spiritual growth according to Masters of the Universe.  ",
        "Potential for Worldliness: Critics also express concern that focusing on worldly influence and political power could lead to a neglect of the spiritual mission of the Church and a compromise with worldly values.  ",
        "Misuse of Spiritual Authority: There are concerns that the emphasis on \"overcomers\" and spiritual authority could lead to spiritual elitism and the abuse of power.  "
