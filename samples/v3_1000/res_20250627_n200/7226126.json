        "God's Nature: Many religions believe God is inherently loving and compassionate. This love is seen as a fundamental aspect of God's being, not something that fluctuates based on human actions.  ",
        "Not Based on Merit: God's love is not a reward for good behavior or a punishment for bad behavior. It's a gift freely given, meaning it doesn't depend on whether a person fulfills certain conditions or meets specific standards.  ",
        "Love for All: Unconditional love implies that God loves everyone, even those who may not love Him back or who may be considered unworthy by human standards.  ",
        "Examples in Scripture: Many religious texts, like the Bible, describe God's love as extending to those who are sinful or who have made mistakes. For example, the Gospel of John describes God's love as so great that He sent His son to die for humanity, even while they were still sinners.  "
