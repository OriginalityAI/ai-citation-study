      "answer": "Foreign exchange intervention affects a country's currency exchange rate by either buying or selling domestic currency in the foreign exchange market. This generally stabilises or alters the value of their domestic currency against a foreign currency. Higher demand strengthens the currency, while higher supply weakens it.",

      "question": "ELI5: How are currency exchange rates determined?",
      "answer": "In most cases, supply and demand. Here's how it was explained to me when I was in school: let's say that America makes Fords and Germany makes Volkswagens. Ford has factories in America, so it has to pay its employees in dollars. Likewise, Volkswagen pays its German factory workers in euros. Let's say lots of Americans want to buy Volkswagens. Volkswagen only accepts euros because that's what they need to pay their workers. So the Americans who want to buy Volkswagens first have to trade euros for dollars. Likewise there are some Germans who presumably want to buy Fords, but they need dollars to buy them. So the Americans who want to buy Volkswagens trade their dollars for euros with the Germans who want to buy Volkswagens. In this scenario, if there are similar numbers of Americans trying to buy Volkswagens as Germans who want to buy Fords, you might expect the exchange rate to be about even. But if suddenly the balance shifts, like say if Volkswagens become a lot more desirable in Am…",

      "question": "I was traveling to India recently and was buying a few hundred US dollars on my way as the money exchanges didn't have any Indian rupees with them. At the exchange counter, they didn't have 100 dollar bills and they asked me if I would like to check other exchange places for 100s saying I would get a lower rate when I buy Indian rupees selling my US dollars in India if they were 50s, 20s etc. Back in the airport in India, I overheard a foreigner arguing with the exchange counter guys asking why he was given a lower rate for low valued notes. They replied saying different rates applies for different notes. Why do they offer lower rates for low valued dollar bills (50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1) and the displayed value is offered only for 100 dollar bills? Is there any economical aspect to this and does it happen everywhere with every other bill?",
      "answer": "When dealing with currency exchanges, it's important to remember that only the local currency is \"money\", all the other currencies are just \"things\". This is the reason behind the \"buying\"/\"selling\" terminology you often see. When you change foreign currency into local currency - in the view of the currency exchange - they are buying your strange pieces of paper with fancy writing on it for actual (local) money. And when you're changing local currency back into foreign currency, they are selling you fancy pieces of paper for real (local) money. (This viewpoint extends even for electronic transactions. It might not be a physical artifact, but it's still some \"non-monetary\" electronic claim, like a transferable airline e-ticket or shares of company stock.) So to directly answer your question, the reason there's a different rate on different bills is because, as non-(\"real\")-money objects, they're non-fungible. One US$100 bill and five US$20 bills may be very similar, but they're not th…",
