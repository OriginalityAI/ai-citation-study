        "title": "Neha Deshpande | A mother’s emotional and mental health deeply influences her child’s well-being. When a mother suppresses her emotions, the unspoken tension and unresolved pain can create an environment of stress that the child unconsciously absorbs. Children are incredibly sensitive to their parents’ emotional states, and they often mirror the anxiety, sadness, or anger that isn’t openly expressed. As a result, the child might develop behavioral issues, anxiety, or even physical symptoms like frequent illnesses. The unhealed wounds of the mother can become the invisible burdens the child carries. It’s crucial for mothers to prioritize their emotional health, not just for their own well-being, but to create a nurturing and secure space for their child to grow. When a mother heals, she breaks the cycle, allowing her child to thrive in a healthy emotional environment.. thanks kat for the discussion!!
