      "question": "How did foreigners begin to gain control over China?",
      "answer": "Hint: The foreign relations and occupations of China have been peculiar in their own right. The modern interference in China can be traced back to its beginning in the Qing dynasty which turned out to be the last dynastic rule in China. Complete answer: After the First Opium War was fought between China and Britain from 1839 to 1842, China had to allow the open trading with Westerners that it had been fending off till then. China seemingly lost the war then as it had been militarily less equipped and modernised as compared to the European powers.

      "answer": "Answer: The spheres of influence meant for China that the Chinese trade was dominated by foreign influence. Explanation: The European powers that formed colonies in most parts of Asia refrained themselves from gaining control over China as they were more interested in doing trade with China . In order to achieve this feat of doing maximum trade with China , most European nations tried to influence the trade in China to function according to the demands of the European countries . This gave rise to the idea of spheres of influence that existed in China and extended to its geographic core where most tradables were manufactured.",
