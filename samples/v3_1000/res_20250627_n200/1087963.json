      "question": "Who was John Locke and why was he considered the most important philosopher of the Enlightenment period?",
      "answer": "John Locke, (1632 - 1704), English philosopher whose works lie at the foundation of modern philosophical empiricism and political liberalism. He was an inspirer of both the European Enlightenment and the Constitution of the United States. His philosophical thinking was close to that of the founders of modern science, especially Robert Boyle, Sir Isaac Newton, and other members of the Royal Society. His political thought was grounded in the notion of a social contract between citizens and in the importance of toleration, especially in matters of religion. Much of what he advocated in the realm of politics was accepted in England after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89 and in the United States after the country’s declaration of independence in 1776. That is why was he considered the most important philosopher of the Enlightenment period.",

      "question": "Who was John Locke? What was his idea of enlightenment?",
      "answer": "John Locke favored a certain set of values — belief in property rights and traditional Christianity — that would make him a “classic liberal,” perhaps, but be considered conservative today. He was a very strong proponent of property rights (this was before Karl Marx), because he didn’t see property as inherently corrupting… Rather, a free market gave rights that benefitted rational humans. Also, he conceived of property as the result of labor freely applied to Nature. And humans came to rightly own property by the effort they put into the Earth and its resources. Especially if they are not coerced or stolen from. Absent an over-privileged nobility or royalty, Locke thought humans would be free, and free exchange of property was the people’s right. But if Locke was a classical liberal, he was a liberal nonetheless. He promoted mostly middle-class values, and one of his most important effects was to discredit the Divine Right of Kings… which he did by rationally attacking some of the a…",

      "question": "As a political science major, I've spent a large part of my time in college reading and studying Enlightenment era philosophers and political thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, Machiavelli (who isn’t part of the Enlightenment era but is important in political science), and Rousseau, to name a few. In the past few quarters, I've been reading more philosophers from the 20th century like thinkers in anti-colonial/post colonial thought like Fanon or Malcom X. I’ve also read communist thinkers like Karl Marx or Emma Goldman for the anarchist perspective. All this to say that, I’ve studied both the Enlightenment era and its advancements in things like reason, logic, universal and equal rights, democracy, and individual liberty; and also philosophers writing in the aftermath of the results of Enlightenment thinking, who bring up the hypocrisy in Enlightenment ideology like; colonialism, genocide, racism, sexism, class divide, white supremacy, and Eurocentrism. None of those aspects that justified the colonization, oppression, and enslavement of many groups of people during that time are reasonable or rational considering the advancements of the Enlightenment period, and create the paradox I’m referring to. My question is, can a movement/ideology like those in the Enlightenment period be fundamentally good/righteous if it is fundamentally flawed? Someone like Fanon or Malcom X would argue that it couldn’t be good or righteous if it’s fundamentally flawed especially if you looked at colonialism or systemic racism, but I’m not sure which side to choose because those same ideas have also lead to many improvements to society as well.",
      "answer": "I don't think there's much use in discussing some sui generis Enlightenment concept, when even much of our orthodox pedagogy discusses them in relation to the deep-seated disagreement these thinkers had with each other. Another thing to note is that despite there being deeply insightful things to be found in radical post-Enlightenment literature, we must not confuse the intent of these texts as promoting particular values and particular solutions to then-contemporary crises with the texts that they were talking about. Its important to set the Enlightenment in its own Enlightenment context. Much of the recent literature that has focused on doing so has discovered that more extravagant theories of Enlightenment complicity in the promotion of racism, colonialism and other bigotries are implausible upon more narrow focus on particular figures (for example, see Uzgalis' \"John Locke, Racism, Slavery, and Indian Lands\" and Brewer's \"Slavery, Sovereignty, and “Inheritable Blood”: Reconsidering…",
