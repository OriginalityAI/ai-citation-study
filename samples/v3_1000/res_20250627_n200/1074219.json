      "snippet": "Top comment · Industrial engineers look at systems of things and try to improve them. Think Industrial Revolution, that’s where the name comes from is from the industrialization process. That can be in a hospital, a Starbucks, Disneyworld, or a manufacturing plant. Pay is good (75-150k in the US depending on experience), it’s a lot easier to finesse into management roles from industrial engineering and so the pay ceiling is pretty high. You can go into business or engineering since IE is the closest major in engineering to business (my college required me to take multiple business electives). Biggest Pro’s for me: IE’s typically have the best work life balance out of the engineering community and there’s something gratifying about helping people. Biggest Con: It is typically a tedious job, people don’t like change and that’s what you do and most change takes forever and is incremental. That can be boring. If you’re starting from scratch an IE degree will be a 4 year degree, make sure it’s ABET accredited because otherwise it’s useless. All engineers have the same 2 years of foundation + 2 years of specialization (so 4 years unless you have all the general education credits completed). Make sure it’s an engineering degree, “industrial tech” and other degrees are not the same thing and are just a business systems degree.",
