      "answer": "Surprisingly, buildings can be made more environmentally friendly through various construction techniques and material choices. Here are some examples: 1. *Sustainable materials*: Use reclaimed wood, bamboo, low-carbon concrete, and recycled materials to reduce waste and minimize environmental impact. 2. *Energy-efficient systems*: Incorporate solar panels, green roofs, and high-performance insulation to reduce energy consumption. 3. *Passive design*: Optimize building orientation, natural lighting, and ventilation to reduce the need for artificial lighting and heating/cooling. 4. *Water conservation*: Implement rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, and low-flow fixtures to minimize water waste. 5. *Green building certifications*: Pursue certifications like LEED, WELL, or Passive House to ensure buildings meet rigorous environmental standards. 6. *Recycled and recyclable materials*: Choose materials with high recycled content and design buildings for deconstruction and reuse. 7…",

      "question": "How can you reduce emissions from construction sites?",
      "answer": "Efficient planning allows for the optimization of construction processes, ensuring that tasks are organized in a way that minimizes energy consumption and resource use. A carefully planned construction schedule can help minimize the overall duration of the project. Shorter construction periods mean less time for equipment and machinery to be operational, reducing the carbon emissions associated with their use. Planning ahead enables the optimization of transportation routes, reducing the distance traveled by construction vehicles. This minimizes fuel consumption and lowers associated carbon emissions.",

      "source": "ResearchGate",
      "question": "How can the processes of thermal modernisation of buildings be accelerated in order to significantly reduce the level of emissivity of buildings, reduce energy consumption, increase energy security, improve air quality, reduce the scale of air pollution and also increase the scale of implementation of strategic objectives of climate and environmental policy, and thus slow down the process of progressive global warming? Many houses in Poland require thermomodernisation. There are more than 6 million single-family homes in Poland, 60 per cent of which are not low-energy, do not have an insulated façade. \"Energy vampires\" account for 16 per cent. This results in high losses of heat and electricity, higher CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and higher costs of paying for heating the home. In this way, energy losses will be reduced and less energy will be produced, less fossil fuels will be burned, smog will be reduced, air quality will be improved and premature deaths of citizens caused by poor air quality will be reduced. This is particularly important in an archaic energy system such as the one we have in Poland, where, because of the energy policy pursued in recent years of deliberately slowing down, restricting and blocking the development of renewable and emission-free sources of energy, three quarters of electricity and three quarters of even more heat is still generated on the basis of burning coal and lignite. Thanks to the environmental policy of the European Union, of which Poland is a member, something is finally beginning to change in a positive direction. Poland is also beginning to join the process of the green transformation of the energy sector, the construction industry, etc., but this is still progressing too slowly because of the leadership of the so-called 'united right' government, i.e. the PIS team and Solidarna Polska, which are deliberately slowing down the process of the green transformation of the economy as much as they can. In doing so, they are pursuing an anti-climate, anti-environmental and consequently anti-social policy as well. The energy certificate provides information about the energy performance of a building. It is required when constructing a new building and when selling it. The introduction of the requirement for an energy certificate in Poland is due to new EU directives, as in Europe one third of greenhouse gas emissions are generated by high-energy buildings. By taking measures to speed up the process of thermo-modernisation of buildings and replacing high-emission energy sources, i.e. replacing coal-fired cookers, the so-called 'kopciuchy', with renewable and emission-free energy sources, there will be a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of buildings, a reduction in energy consumption, an increase in the level of energy security, an improvement in air quality, a reduction in the scale of air pollution and also an increase in the scale of implementation of the strategic objectives of climate and environmental policy. The importance of the issue of enhancing energy security has increased in the context of the 2022 energy crisis. This crisis was particularly profound in a country such as Poland, where, due to the government's blocking and slowing down of the green transformation of the energy sector for many years, including blocking (e.g. wind power since 2016) limiting the development of renewable and emission-free energy sources (e.g. solar energy from April 2022, biofuel-based energy, geothermal energy), failure to undertake the construction of alternative, low-carbon, high-security energy sources (e.g. nuclear and hydrogen energy) electricity and even more thermal energy is still produced on the basis of archaic, dirty fossil fuel combustion energy, mainly coal and lignite combustion. With the thermal modernisation of buildings and also the replacement of coal-fired cookers with renewable and emission-free energy sources, energy-efficient, sustainable low-carbon construction is being developed. This process is counted among the key elements of the green economy transformation process. Carrying out the green economy transformation process aims to build a sustainable, green, zero-emission closed loop economy, which is the most important impact factor for protecting the climate, biosphere and biodiversity of the planet's natural ecosystems. Well, the faster and more efficiently this green transformation of the economy is carried out, the more the progressive process of global warming will be slowed down and the less global climate catastrophe will occur in the future. In view of the above, I address the following question to the esteemed community of scientists and researchers: How can the processes of carrying out thermal retrofitting of buildings be accelerated in order to significantly decarbonise buildings, reduce energy consumption, increase energy security, improve air quality, reduce the scale of air pollution and also increase the scale of achieving the strategic objectives of climate and environmental policy and thus slow down the process of progressive global warming? How can the processes of thermal modernisation of buildings be accelerated in order to significantly decarbonise buildings? What is your opinion on the subject? What do you think about this topic? Please respond, I invite you all to discuss, Thank you very much, I have described the key issues concerning the green transition of the economy in the following article: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT AS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE PRO-ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ECONOMY TOWARDS GREEN ECONOMY AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY DEVE... I invite you to scientific cooperation, Warm regards, Dariusz Prokopowicz",
      "answer": "Firstly thanks to Darius Prokopowicz for raising this concern and writing so much stuff to get things to know better. As far as the concern of Thermal modernization of buildings is here particularly for those countries i.e Europen countries as well as north America such like that., this topic is so good & should not be limited only for this mentioned discussion, it should be discussed widely as well. Some ideas may be: Using Natural products while constructing the building body which naturally works as a thermoregulator. Using Solar power more efficiently & in a more efficient way and can be understood from India, that how they do it.
