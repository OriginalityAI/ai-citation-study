      "source": "Reddit",
      "question": "Is 'pure' iron ever used in modern industry, or is it always just steel?",
      "answer": "On a literal basis, mostly no, because making chemically pure iron is a hassle. On a linguistic basis, sure, cast iron and wrought iron are very popular materials. Neither are pure iron. Cast iron has more carbon in it than steel does. And unless it's in a rare situation where the ambiguity is dangerous, I don't see the problem of referring to alloys that are almost entirely iron as iron. If someone said to me \"I'm an ironworker\" and I replied \"oh, prove you have pure iron, otherwise you're a steelworker\" I would not expect them to be friendly. One of the wires in J-type thermocouples is iron. Might actually be an industrial use of more pure iron, or it might just be steel, I haven't gone deep into looking for chemical specs.",
