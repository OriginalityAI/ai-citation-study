      "question": "Why do we have people with dark skin if we all are descendants of Adam and Eve?",
      "answer": "Well, the Eve part may be accurate - do a search for “Mitochondrial Eve”, (without the quotes). While there is evidence that mitochondrial DNA is not always uniquely passed from the mother, it generally does - this gave rise to the concept that there’s a common female root for present humans. All animals evolve - humans likewise. You can see people that are adapted even in relatively close geographic places. I live in Peru, and the people on the cost are much different than the people of the highlands, and both are different from the jungle people. Naturally, pigment isn’t that important in temperate areas as it is in tropical ones - people also express their desires in choosing mates. This tends to further solidify regional characteristics, even when environmental conditions don’t. Look at it this way: all dogs are descended from the Grey Wolf. There are lots of varieties of dogs around, aren’t there? Having a common ancestor is no guarantee of genetic stability. Quite the contrar…",

      "source": "Quora",
      "question": "How did people develop different skin tones if Adam and Eve were created with perfect white or dark skin?",
      "answer": "Really? With all of the important, life changing questions you could have asked, thi is what you chose? Aside from the fact that absolutely nothing in the Scriptures suggests Adam and Eve's skin color was white or any other color, substitute the color white with any other color (black, brown, yellow, red or purple) you would be in exactly the same place, with same self-imposed dilemma, as you were with the silly question you started with. How do we get different skin colors? Humans are only one small part of God's creation. Look at the rest of creation. Why are not all flowers all the same color? Why are not all fruits, vegetables, trees, marine life, wild life, or anything, anywhere in creation, the same color? All of God's creation is endlessly diverse. It was purely by chance, genes and circumstances that gene pools developed in isolation. If your question is some sort of a sad, sorry reference to differing races, try to process this in your narrow little racist mind: there is only…",

      "question": "If human life started with Adam and Eve, where did all the ethnicities come from? This might be the dumbest question ever idk. Is it because the features of each race come from 1 person in the past? But then how did those features start??",
      "answer": "The word(s) you're looking for are genetic drift. when a population is isolated from other populations, over time, certain features will begin to dominate or become more prevalent in the population. This, coupled with input from natural selection, causes the differences between population groups over time. Basically, you can say \"Adam and Eve possessed all the genetic material for all races\" and then genetic drift caused those races to develop naturally as populations were more isolated from each other (like Native Americans from Sudanese). Or you can say it's all evolution, I don't really care~",
