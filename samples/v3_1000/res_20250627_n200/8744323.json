DUKE: If music be the food of love, play on, Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken and so die.— That strain again;—it had a dying fall; O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south, That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odour.—Enough; no more; 'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.

      "answer": "What this excerpt from Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night reveals about Duke Orsino is that B) He is in love with the idea of love itself. By using the system of elimination, you can come to this solution. He hasn't developed a dislike for music, and this excerpt deals with his ideas about love, which means that C and D are also incorrect. B is because he thought he was truly in love, but realized he is in love with the idea of being in love.",
