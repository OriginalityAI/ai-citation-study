      "source": "Reddit",
      "question": "In WW2 the likes of Spain, Portugal and Switzerland remained neutral, how could these countries stay neutral? What stopped the Axis powers from invading these countries to add to their countries?",
      "answer": "Germany valued the neutrality of the Netherlands In World War I because it allowed access to international trade (the British limited Dutch imports, but the Dutch could cut back on their own consumption and sell to Germany at high prices). Swiss neutrality also had value (and the costs of invasion would be high), and the same went for Sweden in both wars. Both were neutral, pro-German until late in World War II, so sold iron ore, armaments, optics and so on. Portugal was out of reach. Spain was aligned with Germany and Italy ideologically, but demanded a price Germany could not pay to enter the war on Germany's side (guaranteed deliveries of food, oil and armaments and a slice of French North Africa). So the belligerents and the neutrals made their calculations in each case - the costs of invasion and occupation against the value of neutral production. In Iceland's case the Allies occupied it despite neutrality, fearing a German move and needing bases to cover the Atlantic convoy route…",

      "source": "Reddit",
      "question": "Were there any nations totally unaffected by World War 2?",
      "answer": "There were neutral parties all over the globe, and it would vary heavily based on that. For example, Ireland was officially neutral, but due to its proximity to Britain, it would from time to time be hit by mistake. For example, Dublin was hit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dublin_in_World_War_II (I regret to have to use Wikipedia, but they reference several contemporary newspaper accounts). There were instances of cooperation (as documented in the Cranborne Report, though I am not able to find the primary source right this second). Iceland was officially neutral, but was invaded (or garrisoned, depending on how you want to word it) by Britain in 1940. http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/timeline/factfiles/nonflash/a1126496.shtml . It is pretty obvious that Iceland's position in the Atlantic made it very important. (Iceland went independent when Denmark fell.) There were a lot of countries that were not affected much, but I think every nation on some level did somethin…",

      "source": "Quora",
      "question": "Which countries did not participate in World War II? How many of them were neutral and how many remained uninvolved?",
      "answer": "For that question, I see two highly plausible answers, both because Germany didnt want to assure getting their rear handed to them from all sides. No. 1: Switzerland. Abundant in resources and surrounded by Mountains and Woodlands, Switzerland is somewhere you dont want to be as a German soldier. Here, guerilla warfare would be king. You thought the French resistance was effective? This would make them look like a bunch of toddlers with cap guns. Switzerland also has a mandatory military service policy, I believe, so you're fighting pretty much the entire population. Nevermind all the money they stored there. Can you find the anti-tank gun? No. 2 Sweden. Sweden is a pretty calm place, all things considered. Though I do believe they have a total defense policy like Switzerland. They also have a large, patriotic population, with resources that they freely traded with Germany. You've already beaten on the Netherlands. You really think the Swedish people will take a beating like thei…",

      "source": "History Stack Exchange",
      "question": "• Why weren't Spain and Portugal involved in World War II with either side? Was not Franco sympathetic with the Axis powers given the help they offered during the civil war? • Also, given their strategic geographical locations with the ability to limit access the Mediterranean, being a possible landing point for the allies to access France from the south. Or the Germans could have used their access to the Atlantic to build naval bases. The question is why did not any faction from the war invade the peninsula for their advantage?",
      "answer": "I can tell you why Spain was neutral. (Sorry, I don't know much about Portugal) Germany and Italy helped Franco during the Spanish Civil War. When the Second World War started, Germany of 1939 was not very interested in Spain. As you know in May 1940 Italy joined the Axis while France was being conquered. After defeat the Germans prepared themselves to conquer the UK and Africa. In that moment Gibraltar started to be very important for everyone. Meanwhile in Spain Franco wanted to return the favour to Hitler. Summary of his thoughts: • He had an experienced army after 3 years of war. • The army equipment was pretty obsolete, especially against modern allied weapons. • The country was devastated, people were starving. Food and industrial productivity were a shadow of pre-civil war values. • There was huge civil unrest and lot of guerrillas (Maquis) still fighting in Spain. So Franco ordered a report to each branchesf the military: Army, Air Force and Navy. The Army and Air Force repo…",
