      "snippet": "Top comment · Because it’s far more common for the girl to break up with the man, than it is the other way round. It’s often a decision that they come to slowly, over time, before they do it, which allows them to process it before they finally make that decision a reality. From the man’s perspective, it’s obviously a big shock to them, all at once, which isn’t nice. Also, women get hit on all the time. On dating apps, and in the real world. They’re spoiled for choice. They have infinitely more options than men do as far as dating goes.",
