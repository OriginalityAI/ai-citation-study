As commission government officials only answer to the voters, the city would be reflective of the people. D. None of the above.",
      "answer": "The correct answer is C. City Commission Government is a form of local government in the United States. The voters select a small commission, typically of five or seven members, who constitute the legislative and executive body of the city. This body enacts local ordinances and administer them. The commissioners are responsible to the voters . In order to be elected, a commissioner has to present a plan or a vision of goals to be achieved if elected. A candidate may present city planning strategies which appeal to a large number of people. In that case, the commissioner would probably get elected and his city planning initiatives would reflect the ideas of people who voted for him.",
