        "Ownership: When you buy a stock, you're buying a piece of the company, making you a part-owner.  ",
        "Potential Returns: Stocks can provide significant returns through capital appreciation (increase in stock price) and dividends (payments from company profits).  ",
        "Risk: Stocks are generally considered riskier than bonds because their value can fluctuate significantly, and there's no guarantee of returns.  ",
        "Volatility: Stock prices can be volatile, influenced by various factors like company performance, economic conditions, and market sentiment.  ",
        "Potential for Growth: Stocks can offer higher growth potential, especially in the long term, but also carry the risk of losing your investment.  ",
        "Loans: Bonds are essentially loans from investors to a company or government.  ",
        "Fixed Income: Bonds typically offer fixed interest payments (coupons) at regular intervals and repayment of the principal at maturity.  ",
        "Lower Risk: Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks because they offer a more predictable income stream and have a higher claim on assets in case of bankruptcy.  ",
        "Lower Returns: Bond yields (interest rates) are typically lower than potential returns from stocks.  ",
        "Diversification: Bonds can play a crucial role in diversifying a portfolio, offering stability and reducing overall risk.  ",
        "Stocks are for growth-oriented investors who are comfortable with higher risk and potential volatility.  ",
        "Bonds are for more conservative investors seeking stable income and lower risk.  ",
