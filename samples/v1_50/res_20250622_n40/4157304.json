But pistachio imports slowed due to relations with Iran in the early 1980s, and in response, there was a growth in American pistachio producers.",

        "Imported Pistachios and Imperfections: Before the 1970s, the majority of pistachios sold in the US were imported from the Middle East. Traditional harvesting methods often involved letting the nuts fall to the ground before collection, which could lead to stains and blemishes on the shells.  ",
        "Dyeing as a Solution: To make these imported pistachios more appealing to consumers, importers began dyeing them red. This hid the imperfections and gave the nuts a more uniform, bright appearance.  ",
        "Domestic Production and Improved Methods: The rise of domestic pistachio production in California in the 1970s and 80s brought about changes in harvesting and processing. Modern techniques, like immediate hulling and washing, reduced the occurrence of stains and blemishes.  ",
        "Decline of Red Dye: With the shift to domestic production and improved processing, the need for red dye decreased. Consumers also became more aware of the artificial nature of the dye and its potential health implications.  ",
        "Zaloom's Story: Some online sources suggest that a Syrian importer named Zaloom in Brooklyn, New York, may have been the first to dye pistachios red to differentiate them from competitors. However, this is not the most widely accepted explanation.  ",
        "Current State: Today, you'll rarely find red-dyed pistachios in stores, as most pistachios are now processed in a way that eliminates the need for artificial coloring.  "
