      "answer": "The hour hand moves as the minute hand moves. By the time the minute hand makes it around 12 times the hour hand has made one revolution, so the minute hand can't have lapped it 12 times, but 11. That happens twice a day, so: 22 times a day.",

I don't have any more information. so the seconds will pass both the hours and the minutes, and the minutes will pass the hours. There are going to be times when the minute hand is directly over the hour hand, so when the second hand passes over then is that two passes or one?",

      "answer": "Check How many times a day do a clock’s hands overlap? [ https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-a-day-do-a-clock’s-hands-overlap-1 ] If that doesn’t explain well, check the below math I did to solve it : 1 day = 24 hours. Minute hand:- In 60 minutes covers 360 degree, so speed of minute hand is 6 degree per minute. Hour hand:- In 12 hours covers 360 degree, so speed of hour hand is 30 degree per hour or 1/2 degree per minute. Angular relative speed between minute and hour hand = 6–1/2 = 11/2 degree per minute. Let’s see when do minute hand and hour hand overlap, basically start with a reference of 12:00 AM, At this point both are at same position but will now move at different speed. They will overlap at the point when the relative speed between them covers the angular distance of 360 degree. So, time = angular distance/angular relative speed = 360/ (11/2) = 720/11 minutes. In every 720/11 minute, the two hands overlap. So, the number of times the two hands overlap will be equ…",
