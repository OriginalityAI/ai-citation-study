      "list": [
        "In community property states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin), assets acquired during the marriage are generally owned equally by both spouses.  ",
        "This means a surviving spouse is automatically entitled to half of the community property, regardless of what the will says.  ",
        "You can, however, disinherit your spouse from your separate property (assets owned before the marriage or received as a gift or inheritance).  ",
        "In common law states, a surviving spouse can generally claim a portion of the estate, often between one-third and one-half, even if the will tries to disinherit them.  ",
        "This right is often referred to as the \"elective share\".  ",
        "To avoid this, a spouse would need to agree in writing, usually through a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement, to waive their inheritance rights.  ",
        "Intent: Simply omitting a spouse from a will in many states is not enough to disinherit them. You need to explicitly state your intention to disinherit them in the will.  ",
        "Prenuptial/Postnuptial Agreements: These agreements can be used to define how assets will be distributed in case of death or divorce, allowing for more control over inheritance.  ",
        "Challenges: Even with a prenuptial agreement, a spouse may still be able to challenge the will if they can prove undue influence, lack of capacity, or fraud.  ",
        "Legal Advice: It's crucial to consult with an estate planning attorney to understand the specific laws in your state and to ensure your wishes are carried out as effectively as possible.  "
